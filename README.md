This repository will contain files of my code, explanations, and thought processes as I attempt to create my own player evaluation metric for basketball players. This idea stems from the metric PER, which is perhaps the most common and popular player evaluation metric in basketball. However, I hope to create a metric which values players based on how they perform in the role assigned to them by their team or coach.
